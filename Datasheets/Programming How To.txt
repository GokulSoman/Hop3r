This is a guide for programming the Hopp3r custom Tiva MCU boards using a TM4C123G Launchpad.

On the Launchpad, remove the 2-pin power jumper on the ICDI part of the board.

Then, make sure the power switch on the Launchpad is set to "Debug".

Lastly, connect the L-shaped end of the blue programming cable to the header pins
on the rear of the ICDI part of the board. The "L" shape of the headers on the cable
and the Launchpad will match.

On the custom board, insert the single-row end of the blue programming cable into the
7-pin row of female headers. Notice that the pins of the blue programming cable are grouped
with heat-shrink into two groups of two pins, and one group of three pins. The outside pin
in the group of three should connect to pin 7 on the custom board. In the case the pin on the
board is not labelled, the outside pin of the group of three should be connected to the RESET
signal.

The custom board should be connected to a +5V power supply and have a common ground with the
Launchpad board being used as a programmer.

Once these steps have been completed, the custom board can be programmed in exactly the same
manner as programming a single Launchpad board. Also, in this setup, the non-ICDI MCU on the 
Launchpad board being used a programmer will not receive any new code.
